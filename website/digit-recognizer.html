        Hey there! Thank you for checking out my project. 
        We made a cool digit recognizer, and it will try to guess 
        which digit you have drawn on this canvas. Want to give it a shot?
    </p>
    <div id="canvasHolder">
        <canvas id="inputCanvas"></canvas>
    </div>
    <p id="prediction">Draw in the black square to test the model</p>

    <h2>How it does the magic - from your click to a prediction</h2>
    <p>
        What you see in front of you is your browser's visualization of my website. Your browser has asked Movsisyan's server (a computer that holds and serves Movsisyan's files) for the necessary information to recreate everything you see on your screen. In response to your browser's humble request, Movsisyan's server responds with four types of files: HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Pictures/Illustrations. 
        <br/><br/>
        The first file is of type HTML, which stands for Hyper-Text Markup Language. The contents of this file instruct the browser to generate the text and structure of the website you see currently.
        <br/>
        The second file is of type CSS, which stands for Cascading Style Sheets. The contents of this file tell your browser the details about the elements in the HTML file, for example, how big the text should be, which font to use to display it, what colors to use.
        <br/>
        The third file is of type Javascript, which is a programming language. It acts as the logic behind the website; it tells the browser what to do when you click and drag your mouse, how to talk to Mr. MSXCN, and ask for a prediction.
        <br/>
        The fourth and final files are pictures or illustrations that need to be displayed wherever Mr. HTML instructed for them to be displayed.
        <br/><br/>
        Once the browser has displayed the website, you start reading the text within, eventually stumbling upon the black square. The moment you click within it, Mr. Javascipt starts filling the space with black pixels. The moment you let go of the mouse button, Mr. Javascript rushes to center the drawing and sends it to Mr. Server, asking him to predict which digit you drew, and assuming it was, in fact, a digit that you drew.
        <br/><br/>
        Upon receiving the request, Mr. Server scales the picture down and gives it to Mr. MSXCN, who gets excited and tries to predict the digit correctly. Mr. Server does not tell Mr. MSXCN whether or not the prediction was correct since the only way to know if it is, is to ask Mr. Javascript, who then will ask you. You are honest and trustworthy, but some people are not and will jokingly say it is a "5" that they drew when in fact, they drew an "8." This would upset Mr. MSXCN as he would think that his prediction was wrong, making him question his entire life. We do not want that to happen :)
        <br/><br/>
        Mr. Server responds to Mr. Javascript with the digit that was predicted. Mr. Javascript asks Mr. Browser to ignore a part of the old instructions given to him by Mr. HTML and instead display the prediction, to which Mr. Browser kindly agrees.
