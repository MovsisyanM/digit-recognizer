# MSXC Net - Digit Recognition

Hey there, visitor! Welcome to the GitHub repo of my first project with TensorFlow.  
I had a great time working on this project during the summer after my freshman year,  
and I was lucky to have Tigran Avetisyan as a teammate. We created a convolutional  
neural network to classify digits and used two datasets to do so. One of the datasets  
was collected by us for this project, the other being the well-known MNIST dataset.  
Amassing over 5500 observations of drawn digits, we made it possible for the model  
to label digits drawn on a DOM canvas, thus making it possible to test the model  
from anywhere in the world. You can give it a shot at
